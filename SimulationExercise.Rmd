#Overview

This simulation investigates the exponential distribution in R and compares it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution is simulated in R wirh rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda where lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. The distribution of averages is based upon 40 exponentials. And, a total of a 1000 simulations are considered.

###Simulations

Preparing the necessary dataset:
```{r sampling, echo=TRUE}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)

# setting the random generator seed to ensure replicable steps
set.seed(1234);

# declaring known variables 
# (lambda, mean of exp. distribution, standard deviation, number of distribution averages, simulations)
lambda <- 0.2
m_exp <- 1/lambda
sd <- 1/lambda
n <- 40
n_sim <- 1000
```
